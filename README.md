High level scope 

An intuitive & user friendly Mobile app / Web site which will become an everyday companion to guide users on day to day trivial decisions (what color shirt is lucky for me today?) to significant life decisions (can we start this business at this time ?).
The guidance will be influenced by the individuals and groups vedic astrological chart and multiple other proprietary source data maintained and sourced by the platform.

Scope in Detail

			§ LLM integration for answering basic questions based on this input.
			
		○ Phase1 (MVP) :
		
			§ Conversational interface on a light weigh Mobile App and Web 
				□ LLM 
			§ Build the knowledge repository based on publicly available eBooks/ web sites  (Ref similar to BV Raman)
				□ RAG , Vector DB and MCP.
				□ Answer is deterministic , but response is based on Predictive models for the best possible outcome.
			§ Basic personal astrological guidance based on individuals personal data 
				□ Name , DOB & Time , Place of Birth.
			
			§ Preset questions the users can click daily (imagine the daily calendar we peel daily)

		○ Phase2 :
			§ Implementing commercial strategy 
				□ Tiered subscriptions cost 
			§ Enhance the guidance based on partners & family information 
				□ Ex: share your partners data to give more focused guidance 
			§ Capture feedback and relay it back to for retraining the Model (ML Pipeline)
			§ Enhanced data capture , Non intrusive questions to understand users life journey .
			§ Sequence Modeling and Trajectory prediction based on pattern matching from personal data captured.
				□ Individuals current and past life journey mapped with their birth chart.
			§ Personal guidance influenced by Crowd source pattern matches.
			 
		○ Phase3
